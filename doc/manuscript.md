# Abstract

Understanding urban community novelty can help to predict the rewilding
potential of vacant urban spaces, facilitating their integration into
biodiverse cities. We tested the hypothesis that cities are composed of
different degrees of ecological novelty by studying four urban habitats
with differing degrees of management and human legacy: park lawns,
roadsides, residential vacant lots, and industrial vacant lots. We
focused on community compositional novelty, by comparing the plant,
fungal and bacterial species composition between urban habitats and two
reference pre-urban habitats: forests and meadows. We used a
compositional novelty index based on multidimensional ordination, which
is straightforward to calculate and only requires species co-occurrence
data for urban and reference habitats. As expected, (1) plants displayed
the highest novelty and bacteria the lowest; (2) urban communities were
markedly different from forests and relatively more similar to meadows;
and (3) compositional novelty was highest in industrial lots. Managed
park lawns, which we had expected to be highly novel, were relatively
close to hay meadows. The lowest novelty was recorded in residential
vacant lots, which had biological communities that more closely
resembled those of pre-urban habitats. Our results highlight the effect
of habitat type as a major driver of urban community composition and
novelty. This suggests that city biodiversity can be enhanced by an
integrative approach to the urban landscape that favors habitat
heterogeneity by passive rewilding of park lawns, non-intervention on
residential vacant lots, direct restoration of industrial lots, and
conservation of natural and agricultural habitat remnants as sources of
native species.

# Introduction

Urban development affects landscape composition and related biodiversity
patterns worldwide ([Grimm et al., 2008](#ref-RN5627)). Urbanization
converts natural and agricultural habitats into a fine-scale mosaic of
diverse urban habitats varying in size, fragmentation, past and present
land uses, and degrees of human intervention ([Pauleit & Breuste,
2011](#ref-RN5527)). At the same time, novel urban habitats experience
climatic differences from the surrounding landscape, as well as high
within-city microclimatic variation ([Forman, 2014](#ref-RN5603);
[Parlow, 2011](#ref-RN5601)). Urban soils likewise vary in permeability,
compaction, organic matter content and human-concentrated chemicals
([Forman, 2014](#ref-RN5603); [Sauerwein, 2011](#ref-RN5623)).

Urban habitats are colonized by organisms from the regional species pool
that are capable of living in urban environments ([Johnson et al.,
2017](#ref-RN2300)). The process of colonization requires species to
pass through a series of hierarchical filters (biogeographical, abiotic,
biotic and human) resulting in the formation of an urban species pool
and the assembly of specialized urban communities ([Aronson et al.,
2016](#ref-RN2306); [Swan et al., 2021](#ref-RN5505)). Urbanization
promotes specialized ruderal species and traits ([Di Giulio et al.,
2024](#ref-RN5613); [Raposo et al., 2024](#ref-RN5622); [Sotillo et al.,
2024](#ref-RN5679)), and thus urban communities are rich in species that
can tolerate urban disturbance, drought and pollution ([Forman,
2014](#ref-RN5603)). For this reason, the urban biota can be a source of
nature-based solutions, such as the bioremediation of degraded soils
([Matanzas et al., 2021](#ref-RN5449); [Song et al., 2019](#ref-RN5447))
and ecosystem design ([Klaus & Kiehl, 2021](#ref-RN5628); [Perrelet et
al., 2024](#ref-RN5629)). Urban communities also host a high proportion
of the regional biodiversity ([Fernández-Pascual et al.,
2025](#ref-RN5600); [Gentili et al., 2024](#ref-RN5682)) and make up a
major part of the supply of natural elements in densely populated
landscapes ([Kowarik, 2018](#ref-RN5445)). Proper management of urban
communities can turn them into assets with high ecological and social
returns ([Anderson & Minor, 2017](#ref-RN5446); [Fekete et al.,
2024](#ref-RN5678); [Itescu & Jeschke, 2024](#ref-RN5676)).

The diversity of urban communities can be characterized along two axes:
naturalness and novelty ([Kowarik, 2018](#ref-RN5445)). Naturalness
refers to the degree of self-organization, i.e., the extent to which
community composition and functions are self-assembled or dependent on
direct human inputs ([Kowarik, 2018](#ref-RN5445)). Novelty refers to
the degree of differentiation from the historical reference communities
that existed in the area before urbanization ([Teixeira et al.,
2021](#ref-RN5673); [Teixeira & Fernandes, 2020](#ref-RN5674)). For
example, urban communities under direct human management (e.g., park
lawns) should have low naturalness and high novelty. When management
stops, naturalness increases, and the community can either transition
back to a state resembling the historical reference (e.g., a low novelty
hay meadow) or into a novel assemblage of species (e.g., a high novelty
urban grassland with non-native species) ([Teixeira et al.,
2021](#ref-RN5673); [Teixeira & Fernandes, 2020](#ref-RN5674)). The fate
of a specific urban site will depend on the interaction between the
legacy of human intervention and inherent site characteristics ([Cramer
et al., 2008](#ref-RN2305)). Intense human legacies usually push
communities into novel states, often dominated by non-native and
otherwise unwanted taxa ([Dunn & Heneghan, 2011](#ref-RN5604); [Forman,
2014](#ref-RN5603)), which usually require more intensive and costly
actions to restore the land for conservation purposes ([Cramer et al.,
2008](#ref-RN2305)). Understanding the patterns and drivers of urban
community novelty can help to predict the restoration and rewilding
potential of vacant urban spaces, facilitating their integration into
the management of biodiversity in cities.

The goal of this article was to test the hypothesis that urban habitats
are comprised of different degrees of ecological novelty ([Teixeira &
Fernandes, 2020](#ref-RN5674)). We addressed this hypothesis by studying
four urban habitats representing different land uses and human legacies,
from managed park lawns to relatively unmanaged strips of land along
transportation corridors, physically altered soils in residential vacant
lots, and highly contaminated industrial brownfields. To address
community compositional novelty, we compared the plant, fungal and
bacterial species composition between urban habitats and two reference
pre-urban habitats: forest remnants and hay meadows. We expected novelty
to be the highest for plants, which in many cases are the object of
direct management and introduction ([Lázaro-Lobo et al.,
2024](#ref-RN5493)); and lowest for bacteria, which should be less
affected than fungi by the usually alkaline urban soils ([Forman,
2014](#ref-RN5603)). We expected novelty to be higher when urban
habitats are compared to natural habitats (forests), and lower when
compared to agricultural habitats (meadows). We also expected novelty to
be higher in the actively managed habitat (park lawns) and in the
unmanaged habitat with the highest human legacy (industrial
brownfields). Finally, we expected that compositional novelty would be
related to soil physicochemical properties, reflecting the major aspect
of human legacy in urban habitats. To test these expectations, we
tackled three main research goals: (1) to characterize the variation in
soil properties across urban and pre-urban habitats; (2) to characterize
the variation in plant, fungal and bacterial communities across urban
and pre-urban habitats; and (3) to measure the compositional novelty
across habitats and taxonomic groups.

# Materials and methods

## Study city

Gijón/Xixón is a medium-sized coastal city (c. 270,000 inhabitants;
Instituto Nacional de Estadística) located in the Bay of Biscay, within
the central Asturias metropolitan area (c. 800,000 inhabitants) of
northern Spain. The city belongs to the Cantabrian Mixed Forests
ecoregion ([Fernández-Pascual et al., 2025](#ref-RN5600); [Lázaro-Lobo
et al., 2024](#ref-RN5493)), at the border between the temperate and
Mediterranean climatic zones of Europe. Climate is temperate oceanic
with cool summers and wet and mostly frost-free winters (mean annual
temperature = 13.5 ºC, annual precipitation = 1062 mm; 1981-2010 data
provided by Agencia Estatal de Meteorología). Most of the city is built
on alluvial and estuarine deposits, sand or limestone bedrock. The
potential pre-human vegetation was likely dominated by deciduous mixed
forests, together with riparian forests, wetlands and coastal dunes. The
area has a long history of human habitation dating back to the
Cantabrian Upper Paleolithic ([Straus, 2005](#ref-RN5450)). The city
itself has been inhabited at least since Roman times ([Fernández Ochoa &
Martínez Díaz, 1987](#ref-RN5532)). During the medieval and early modern
times, the urban center was limited to the original walled city, with
fishing being the main economic activity. Expansion beyond the original
core started in the 18th and 19th centuries. Exposure to global trade
networks and the warm temperate climate turned the region into a hotspot
for biological invasions, especially from the Americas and Asia
([Lázaro-Lobo et al., 2024](#ref-RN5493)). In 1852, the city was
connected by railway to regional mining and industrial centers and
became a major shipping port ([Gómez-Martín & Cañal-Fernández,
2024](#ref-RN5675)). During the following century the city experienced
significant industrial development (e.g., canning, coal, steel,
shipbuilding) and rapid population growth, becoming the most populated
city in the Principality of Asturias ([Obeso Muñiz & Fernández García,
2017](#ref-RN5683)). Industrial and urban growth brought environmental
problems including loss of natural wetlands and air and watercourse
pollution ([Utanda Moreno & Feo Parrondo, 1995](#ref-RN5535)). Starting
in the 1970s, the city and the metropolitan area have been affected by
post-industrial land-use changes leaving large abandoned industrial
sites (i.e., brownfields) ([Gallego et al., 2016](#ref-RN5448);
[Matanzas et al., 2021](#ref-RN5449)).

## Definition of urban habitats

To survey urban biodiversity across habitats, we defined six habitat
types (**Figure 1A**) representing different theoretical states of
naturalness and novelty ([Kowarik, 2018](#ref-RN5445)): (1) forest
patches \< 10 km from the city center, i.e., remnants of pre-urban
natural habitats; (2) late mown hay meadows, i.e., remnants of pre-urban
agricultural habitats; (3) park lawns, i.e., green spaces created and
maintained by humans; (4) roadsides, i.e., relatively unmanaged strips
of land alongside roads and train tracks; (5) residential vacant lots,
i.e., currently unmanaged land which has suffered some degree of soil
physical disturbance and is waiting to be urbanized; and (6) industrial
vacant lots, i.e., currently unmanaged land with an intense legacy of
soil disturbance and contamination.

## Sampling plots

During June 2023, we surveyed the city to establish five sampling plots
(4 x 4 m) per each of the six habitat types (n = 30 plots). The same
plot size was maintained in the forest patches for comparability. The
plots were distributed across the city (**Figure 1B**) and represent the
variation of vegetation types found within each habitat type. In one
plot per habitat (**Figure 1B**), we buried a datalogger (M-Log5W,
GeoPrecision, Ettlingen, Germany; accuracy: +/- 0.1 ºC (at 0 ºC),
resolution: 0.01 ºC) at a depth of 5 cm below the upper layer of the
soil. Dataloggers recorded temperature hourly for one year (1 Jan to 31
Dec 2024), after which we downloaded their records to describe the
thermal environment of the city and the habitats.

## Soil physicochemical sampling

From each of the 30 plots, we collected 500 g of soil to analyse soil
physicochemical properties. We took the samples from 5 points in each
plot (center + 4 cardinal points), down to a depth of 10 cm. We removed
stones and other debris, sieved the soils in a 5 mm mesh and homogenized
the samples in a plastic bag. Samples were analyzed at INEA Laboratory
(Valladolid, Spain), following the standard methodology of the Spanish
Ministry of Agriculture ([Vallejo Acevedo, 1994](#ref-RN5599)). Soil
analysis included pH, texture, bulk density, electrical conductivity,
organic matter content, total N, C/N ratio, active limestone, total
carbonates, assimilable P, K, Ca, Mg, Na and heavy metals (Zn, Cr, Cu,
Cd, Hg, Pb, Ni).

## Plant, fungal and bacterial diversity sampling

In each plot, we recorded all the spontaneous vascular plant species, as
well as the cover (%) of each species in the plot. Plant species names
follow Euro+Med ([Euro+Med, 2006](#ref-RN5044)). Additionally, from each
of the 30 plots, we collected soil samples for DNA metabarcoding of
fungal and bacterial (including Archaea) communities. We performed the
sampling in sterile conditions, and always before entering the plot for
any of the other tasks. We cleaned and sterilized all tools with water
and ethanol between samples. In each plot, we took samples from the four
cardinal points, 0.5 m inwards from the edge, at a depth of 5 cm. Before
taking the samples, we removed the vegetation with a sterile tool. Then,
we collected the soil samples in a 50 ml Falcon tube, mixed them,
homogenized them with a lancet and finally stored the sample in a 2 ml
Eppendorf tube which we immediately froze. The frozen tubes were sent to
AllGenetics & Biology SL (A Coruña, Spain) for DNA metabarcoding
analysis. The DNA analysis included DNA extraction; library preparation
with 2 pairs of different primers specific for barcoding (ITS for fungi,
and 16S for bacteria); sequencing on an Illumina NovaSeq PE250 platform
(assuming an amplicon size \< 450 bp); and standard bioinformatic
analysis including demultiplexing, quality control and sample
preprocessing, inference of Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs), taxonomic
assignment, number of reads per taxon and generation of rarefaction
curves (see **Supplementary material 1** for extended DNA metabarcoding
methodology).

## Statistical analysis and compositional novelty index

We performed all analyses using R version 4.3.1 ([R Core Team,
2023](#ref-RN5387)) and the package *tidyverse* ([Wickham et al.,
2019](#ref-RN4662)) for data manipulation and visualization. To describe
soil temperatures as recorded by the dataloggers, we calculated the mean
annual temperature, the mean diurnal range and the annual range. To
assess the variability in soil physicochemical properties, we conducted
a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as implemented in the R package
*FactoMineR* ([Lê et al., 2008](#ref-RN3166)) and a correlation analysis
to detect auto-correlated soil variables. Multivariate analyses of
community composition were performed in *vegan* ([Oksanen et al.,
2022](#ref-RN5386)): we used PERMANOVA to test differences between
habitat types in their soil variables and their composition of plant
species, fungal ASVs and bacterial ASVs; Non-metric Multi-Dimensional
Scaling (NMDS, see details below) ordination to assess variation in
taxonomic composition of plants (for comparison with fungal and
bacterial communities, we used presence/absence of plant species,
instead of cover), fungi (presence/absence of ASVs) and bacteria
(presence/absence of ASVs); and environmental fitting to test the
correlation between community ordination axes and soil physicochemical
properties.

To calculate a compositional novelty index, we used the NMDS
multidimensional distance from each urban plot (i.e., park, roadside,
residential or industrial) to the centroid of the two reference
pre-urban habitats (i.e., forests and meadows). We calculated
compositional novelty separately for plant, fungal and bacterial
communities. Because NMDS employs an iterative algorithm to seek optimal
solutions, the results may vary across different computational runs,
leading to inconsistencies in ordination outcomes. Therefore, we also
considered alternative ordination methods based on eigenvalue
decomposition (Principal Component Analysis PCA with Hellinger
transformation, and Principal Coordinates Analysis PCoA of a Bray–Curtis
dissimilarity matrix). The final output and interpretation of the
analyses remained stable independently of the ordination method used,
and therefore we decided to use NMDS for the final presentation of
results, since it makes fewer assumptions about data and is therefore a
more flexible technique that can be applied to a wider variety of
datasets. We computed NMDS using the Bray-Curtis distance. When using
NMDS for assessing variation in taxonomic composition, we fitted the
analysis to 2 dimensions, since the goal was visualization of the
biplot. In this case, the best solution was achieved after 20 runs for
plants (stress = 0.15), 20 runs for fungi (stress = 0.12) and 20 runs
for bacteria (stress = 0.09). When using NMDS for calculating novelty,
we fitted the analysis to 4 dimensions, to allow for a better fit. In
this case, the best solution was achieved after 20 runs for plants
(stress = 0.08), 20 runs for fungi (stress = 0.07) and 20 runs for
bacteria (stress = 0.04). The plot-centroid distances (i.e., the novelty
index) were calculated by summing the distances in each of the four
dimensions.

After calculating the novelty indices, we tested the effect of taxonomic
group (plant, fungi and bacteria), pre-urban reference habitat (forest
or meadow), urban habitat (park, roadside, residential or industrial)
and soil physicochemical variables (after reducing their dimensionality
by ordination analysis, see results for more details) on compositional
novelty, by fitting a Linear Mixed Model with the package *nlme*
([Pinheiro et al., 2020](#ref-RN2333)). Total sample size in the model
was 120 (5 plots x 4 urban habitats x 2 reference habitats x 3 taxonomic
groups). Because each sampling plot was included in the model six times
(2 reference habitats x 3 taxonomic groups), the model included plot as
a random factor. We checked and confirmed model assumptions using the
package *performance* ([Lüdecke et al., 2021](#ref-RN5684)).

# Results

## Soil properties across habitats

Soil temperature records (**Figure 2A**) indicated that the forest soil
was relatively buffered in its thermal range of variation, with a mean
annual temperature of 13.9 ºC, a mean diurnal range of 1.8 ºC and an
annual range of 10.8 ºC. Meadow and urban plots had more thermal
oscillation, with a mean annual temperature between 12.4 ºC (roadsides)
and 16.8 ºC (meadows), a mean diurnal range between 3.8 ºC (roadsides)
and 4.6 ºC (residential lots), and an annual range between 16.5 ºC
(residential lots) and 19.5 ºC (meadows).

The PCA ordination of the soil physicochemical properties
(**Supplementary material 2**) indicated that the first axis of
variation, explaining 23% of the variance, ordered soils according to
the concentration of heavy metals. The variables with the highest
contribution to this axis (\> 10%) were the soil contents in Pb, Cu, Zn,
Cd and Cr. This first axis did not separate urban from pre-urban
habitats: for example, while some industrial lots had a very high
concentration of Pb and other metals, the median Pb value of the
industrial habitat was below the median value of forests (**Figure 2B**;
**Supplementary material 2**).

The second PCA axis (**Supplementary material 2**) explained 21% of the
variance and ordered soils according to their compaction and water
retention capacities, with the highest contributing variables (\> 10%)
being organic matter content, bulk density, N concentration and pH. This
axis separated soils according to their habitat: for example, forests
had high organic matter and N content, while industrial vacant lots had
higher bulk density and pH (**Figure 2B**; **Supplementary material
2**).

The third PCA axis (**Supplementary material 2**) explained 10% of the
variability and ordered soils according to their content in Mg, with the
highest contributing variables (\>10%) being Mg content, Mg/K ratio and
conductivity. In this case, as for the first axis, there was no clear
separation between habitats, with industrial sites having some of the
highest and lowest values (**Figure 2B**; **Supplementary material 2**).

The analysis showed strong correlations within the groups of variables
contributing to the first, second and third PCA axes (**Supplementary
material 2**). For further analyses we kept these three axes as
explanatory variables. For simplicity, we will refer to each axis by the
name of the explanatory variable most strongly associated with that axis
(PC1 = Pb; PC2 = organic matter (OM); PC3 = Mg).

As previously indicated by PCA, organic matter was the only soil
property with a clear pattern of variation by habitat: a decrease from
pre-urban to urban habitats (**Figure 2B**). PERMANOVA supported that
there was not a significant difference between habitats in their soil
physicochemical properties (100,000 permutations, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.19,
F = 1.15, p = 0.31).

## Plant, fungal and bacterial communities across habitats

The survey of spontaneous plant diversity yielded 216 species, with the
average richness per plot being 26 (min = 10, max = 38). Of these
species, 48% were found only in urban habitats (parks, roadsides,
residential lots and industrial lots), 27% occurred only in pre-urban
habitats (forests and meadows) and 25% were shared by both urban and
pre-urban habitats (**Fig3A**). On average, the habitat with the highest
richness per plot was industrial lots (29 species), followed by
residential lots (27), roadsides (24), meadows (23), parks (20) and
forests (18). The most frequent species were *Holcus lanatus* (22
plots), *Plantago lanceolata* (20), *Helminthotheca echioides* (16),
*Dactylis glomerata* (15) and *Lotus corniculatus* (14). PERMANOVA
supported that the plant species composition was significantly different
across habitats (100,000 permutations, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.42, F = 3.48, p
= \< 0.001). The NMDS ordination of the plant species composition
(**Fig. 3D**) indicated that the plots belonging to the same habitat
were relatively grouped together. The major gradient in vegetation
composition along the first axis was a separation between forest plots
and the other habitats. Environmental fitting of the soil property axes
PC1, PC2, and PC3 onto the ordination indicated that only PC1 (mainly
explained by Pb) had a significant correlation (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.29, p
= 0.008) with the plant community composition. High values of Pb (and
other heavy metals) were associated with the plant communities from
industrial vacant lots and roadsides (**Fig. 3D**).

The DNA metabarcoding of soil fungal communities resulted in 4,689
amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). Of these, 46% were only found in
urban habitats (parks, roadsides, residential lots and industrial lots),
36% occurred only in pre-urban habitats (forests and meadows) and 18%
were shared by both urban and pre-urban habitats (**Fig3B**). The
average number of ASVs per plot was 340 (min = 174, max = 587), with the
habitat averages decreasing from residential vacant lots (415) to
forests (393), meadows (336), parks (323), industrial vacant lots (300)
and roadsides (276). The majority of ASVs were assigned to Ascomycota
(56%), followed by Basidiomycota (24%), Rozellomycota (10%) and
Glomeromycota (4%). Forest habitats had the highest proportion of
Basidiomycota (25% vs. \< 17% in the other habitats) and the lowest
proportion of Ascomycota (57% vs. \> 64%). The proportion of
Rozellomycota was similar across habitats (from 6% in meadows to 11% in
parks). The proportion of Glomeromycota varied between 5% in meadows to
0.5% in forests. PERMANOVA performed on the presence/absence of ASVs
indicated significant differences in composition between habitats
(100,000 permutations, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.33, F = 2.39, p = \< 0.001).
The NMDS ordination of the fungal ASV composition (**Fig. 3E**) behaved
similarly to the ordination of plant communities, with plots tending to
group by habitat, and the major compositional gradient reflecting the
separation between forest plots and the rest. Environmental fitting of
the soil property axes PC1, PC2, and PC3 onto the ordination indicated
that only PC2 (mainly explained by organic matter) had a significant
correlation (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.46, p \< 0.001) with the fungal community
composition. Low organic matter content was associated with the fungal
communities from industrial vacant lots and roadsides (**Fig. 3E**).

For bacterial communities, DNA metabarcoding yielded 16,306 ASVs. Of
these, 44% were found only in urban habitats (parks, roadsides,
residential lots and industrial lots), 31% occurred only in pre-urban
habitats (forests and meadows) and 25% were shared by both urban and
pre-urban habitats (**Fig3C**). The average number of ASVs per plot was
1769 (min = 1478, max = 2074), with the habitat averages decreasing from
roadsides (1848) to industrial lots (1794), residential lots (1792),
meadows (1775), parks (1706) and forests (1697). The majority of ASVs
were assigned to Proteobacteria (22%), Planctomycetota (15%),
Actinobacteriota (15%) and Acidobacteriota (10%). Compared to other
habitats, forests had higher proportions of Proteobacteria and
Acidobacteriota, a lower proportion of Actinobacteriota, and a similar
proportion of Planctomycetota. PERMANOVA performed on the
presence/absence of ASVs indicated significant differences in
composition between habitats (100,000 permutations, R<sup>2</sup> =
0.32, F = 2.51, p = \< 0.001). The NMDS ordination of the bacterial ASV
composition (**Fig. 3F**) resulted in less grouping by habitat than for
plants and fungi, but still reflected a main compositional gradient from
forests to industrial vacant plots. As in the case of the fungal
communities, environmental fitting of the soil property axes PC1, PC2,
and PC3 onto the ordination indicated that only PC2 (mainly explained by
organic matter) had a significant correlation (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.39, p =
0.001) with the bacterial community composition. Low organic matter
content correlated with the communities from industrial vacant lots and

## Compositional novelty across habitats and taxonomic groups

We used the NMDS multidimensional compositional distance from each of
the urban plots (i.e., park, roadside, residential or industrial) to the
centroid of the two reference pre-urban habitats (i.e., forests and
meadows) to calculate a compositional novelty index (**Fig. 4**).
Novelty was significantly different between taxonomic groups (F = 40.67,
p \< 0.001; see **Supplementary material 3** for full details of the
Linear Mixed Model), being higher for plants (2.37 ± 0.34 S.E.) than for
fungi (2.15 ± 0.40 S.E.) and bacteria (1.56 ± 0.30 S.E.). Novelty was
also significantly different depending on the pre-urban habitat that was
used as a reference (F = 227.99, p \< 0.001), being higher compared to
forests (2.60 ± 0.28 S.E.) than to meadows (1.46 ± 0.28 S.E.).
Nonetheless, for each taxonomic group, there was a high positive
correlation between the novelty compared against forests and meadows (r
= 0.5 for plants; 0.7 for fungi; 0.9 for bacteria). Different urban
habitats also differed significantly in their novelty (F = 10.06, p =
0.001), being higher in industrial vacant lots (2.39 ± 0.32 S.E.) than
in roadsides (2.17 ± 0.36 S.E.), parks (1.88 ± 0.42 S.E.) and
residential vacant lots (1.66 ± 0.34 S.E.). Of the soil physicochemical
properties (i.e., the Pb, organic matter, and Mg axes), only Mg had a
marginally significant positive effect on compositional novelty (F =
5.63, p = 0.03).

# Discussion

This study shows the compositional novelty of biological communities
across urban habitats when they are compared with two reference
pre-urban habitats: forest remnants and agricultural hay meadows. As
expected, (1) novelty was the highest for plant communities and the
lowest for soil bacteria; (2) urban communities were markedly different
from forest communities and relatively more similar to meadow
communities; and (3) the degree of compositional novelty was the highest
among industrial vacant lots. However, managed park lawns, which we had
expected to be highly novel, were relatively close in composition to hay
meadows. Among urban habitats, the residential vacant lots had the
lowest novelty, with biological communities that more closely resembled
those of the reference pre-urban habitats.

## Contrasting diversity patterns in plant-bacterial vs. fungal communities

Our survey found 216 vascular plant species growing in the study plots,
representing 9 % of the regional flora ([Fernández Prieto et al.,
2014](#ref-RN3300)). The highest plant species richness was recorded in
vacant industrial and residential plots, while forests displayed the
lowest. It must be considered that vacant lots, especially those of
industrial origin, had a high number of non-native species, including
five that are classified as highly impactful invasives in the ecoregion:
*Buddleja davidii*, *Cortaderia selloana*, *Dittrichia viscosa*,
*Paspalum dilatatum* and *Sporobolus indicus* ([Lázaro-Lobo et al.,
2024](#ref-RN5493)). Still, vacant lots had more species than forests
even considering only native plants. Contrary to plants, fungi had
higher richness in our forest plots than in the roadsides or industrial
vacant lots, with forests being especially rich in Basidiomycota, as
found in other studies ([Hui et al., 2017](#ref-RN5630); [Marczylo et
al., 2021](#ref-RN5607)). This agrees with previous reports of fungal
communities decreasing with urbanization ([Abrego et al.,
2020](#ref-RN5609)). One potential explanation for this decrease is the
tendency of urban soils to be alkaline, favoring bacteria over fungi
([Delgado-Baquerizo et al., 2021](#ref-RN5606); [Forman,
2014](#ref-RN5603)). Indeed, in our study, organic matter content
(highly and inversely correlated with pH) was the soil variable that had
an effect on the composition of fungal and bacterial communities; and
bacterial richness was higher in urban habitats versus forests (i.e.,
the opposite to fungi).

## Relatively low novelty in parks lawns and residential vacant lots

We used a compositional novelty index based on multidimensional
ordination, which is straightforward to calculate and only requires data
on species co-occurrence for urban and reference habitats. As such, this
index can help to characterize and compare novelty across urban
habitats, which is a major research goal for novel ecosystem research
([Teixeira et al., 2021](#ref-RN5673); [Teixeira & Fernandes,
2020](#ref-RN5674)). Contrary to our expectations, managed park lawns
showed a relatively low novelty for all three taxonomic groups when
compared to agricultural meadows. This indicates that park lawns have a
high potential for low-cost urban rewilding policies, such as
low-frequency and late mowing, which could convert lawns into urban
grasslands rich in native biota and resembling traditional hay meadows.
Urban grasslands are able to hold a high portion of the plant diversity
found in their rural counterparts ([Swacha et al., 2024](#ref-RN5677)),
especially when seminatural habitat remnants are available in the
neighboring landscape to serve as a source of species ([Gros et al.,
2023](#ref-RN5611)). We also found that residential vacant lots have a
relatively low level of novelty, including a high richness of fungi and
native plants. These temporarily unmanaged sites are therefore a highly
valuable asset to integrate biodiversity in cities ([Anderson & Minor,
2017](#ref-RN5446); [Kowarik, 2018](#ref-RN5445)). Additionally,
identifying synanthropic and native species able to thrive in these
vacant lots can help to find candidate species for urban landscaping
that require low levels of watering, fertilization, weeding or mowing
([Bretzel et al., 2024](#ref-RN5614); [Fekete et al.,
2024](#ref-RN5678)). Such native and hardy seed mixes are important
tools for urban greening, given the increasing awareness of the
importance of using locally sourced seed for restoration and rewilding
([Hancock et al., 2023](#ref-RN5617)).

## Conclusions

Our results highlight the effect of habitat type as a major driver of
urban community composition and compositional novelty, supporting the
findings of previous studies ([Gill et al., 2020](#ref-RN5608); [Hui et
al., 2017](#ref-RN5630); [Marczylo et al., 2021](#ref-RN5607)). The high
impact of habitat types on shaping urban communities and their
compositional novelty may be related to the fact that anthropogenic
vegetation is highly responsive to habitat-specific disturbance regimes
([Fernández-Pascual et al., 2025](#ref-RN5600)), while soil microbial
communities are in turn highly conditioned by plant inputs ([Hui et al.,
2017](#ref-RN5630)). These results suggest that city biodiversity can be
enhanced by an integrative approach to the urban landscape that favors
habitat heterogeneity by passive rewilding of managed park lawns,
non-intervention on residential vacant lots, direct restoration of
industrial vacant lots, and conservation of natural and agricultural
habitat remnants as sources of native species ([Dylewski et al.,
2023](#ref-RN5612); [Fekete et al., 2024](#ref-RN5678); [Labadessa &
Ancillotto, 2023](#ref-RN5610)). In this way, the potential of urban
habitats can be mobilized so they continue to support ecosystem
functioning in anthropogenic city landscapes ([Fan et al.,
2023](#ref-RN5605); [Torija et al., 2025](#ref-RN5681); [Weiskopf et
al., 2024](#ref-RN5680)).
